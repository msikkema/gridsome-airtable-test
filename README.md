# Gridsome + Airtable test
This is a quick project to test how difficult it is to generate a static site from Airtable (spoiler: not difficult at all)

## 1. Install Gridsome CLI tool if you don't have

`npm install --global @gridsome/cli`

## 2. run gridsome develop

### 3. visit localhost:8080

You can also visit `http://localhost:8080/___explore` to play with the interactive GraphQL playground
